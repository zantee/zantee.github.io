Hello! I’m Tianyu Zhang (张天宇, click to learn the story of my name). I’m a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [David Brang](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/djbrang.html). Currently, my research interests lie within the domain of attention and multi-sensory perception, focusing on the mutual influences between visual and auditory information. 

Before joining UMich, I gained my master's degree in psychology at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) under the guidance of Prof. [Yong-Chun Cai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongchuncai_ch#0), working on how attention and eye movement shapes basic-level visual perception. 

Before my master, I was an undergraduate student in psychology (with a minor in economics) at Fudan University (Shanghai, China). My undergraduate research was mentored by Prof. [Jin-Mian Yang](http://read.scnu.edu.cn/a/20230220/32.html), focusing on eye movement control mechanisms in Chinese reading.

I deeply believe that sensory perception lays the foundation for our higher-order cognition, and in turn, our cognitive processes shape our perceptual experience. I look forward to doing something elegant and interesting in these perception-cognition interactions during the PhD. Ultimately, I hope to get a quasi-comprehensive understanding of how we construct our rich perceptual and cognitive experience.

Outside the lab, I also enjoy a life full of rich perceptual and cognitive experience. I love many things (but the things are continuously changing). Recently the non-academic elements in my life are swimming, playing Brawl Stars, and Chinese seal carving. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
