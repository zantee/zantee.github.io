Hello! I‚Äôm Tianyu Zhang (Âº†Â§©ÂÆá, click to learn the story of my name). I‚Äôm a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [David Brang](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/djbrang.html). Currently, my research interests lie within the domain of attention and multi-sensory perception, focusing on the mutual influences between visual and auditory information. Ultimately, I hope to get a quasi-comprehensive understanding of how we construct our rich perceptual and cognitive experience.

Before joining UMich, I gained my master's degree in psychology at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) under the guidance of Prof. [Yongchun Cai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongchuncai_ch#0), working on how attention and eye movement shapes basic-level visual perception. 

Before my master, I was an undergraduate student in psychology (with a minor in economics) at Fudan University (Shanghai, China). My undergraduate research was mentored by Prof. [Jinmian Yang](http://read.scnu.edu.cn/a/20230220/32.html), focusing on eye movement control mechanisms in Chinese reading.

Outside the lab, I also enjoy a life full of rich perceptual and cognitive experience. I love many things (but the things are continuously changing). Recently the non-academic elements in my life are swimming, playing Brawl Stars, and Chinese seal carving.
